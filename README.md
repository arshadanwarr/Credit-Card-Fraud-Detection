# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project builds a Credit Card Fraud Detection system using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The dataset is highly imbalanced, so SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the classes. The model is trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate with high accuracy.

Key Features
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, feature scaling, and balancing data using SMOTE.
âœ… Model Architecture â€“ Implemented an ANN using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple layers.
âœ… Performance Evaluation â€“ Achieved high precision and recall for fraud detection.

Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
SMOTE for data balancing.

This project serves as a starting point for fraud detection systems using deep learning. ðŸš€
